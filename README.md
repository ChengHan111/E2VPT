# E2VPT: An Effective and Efficient Approach for Visual Prompt Tuning
------

This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation for E2VPT: An Effective and Efficient Approach for Visual Prompt Tuning. Our work is based on Visual Prompt Tuning, and we thank the great work of them. 

As the size of transformer-based models continues to grow, fine-tuning these large-scale pretrained vision models for new tasks has become increasingly parameter-intensive. Parameter-efficient learning has been developed to reduce the number of tunable parameters during fine-tuning. Although these methods show promising results, there is still a significant performance gap compared to full fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we propose an Effective and Efficient Visual Prompt Tuning (E2VPT) approach for large-scale transformer-based model adaptation. Specifically, we introduce a set of learnable key-value prompts and visual prompts into self-attention and input layers, respectively, to improve the effectiveness of model fine-tuning. Moreover, we design a prompt pruning procedure to systematically prune low importance prompts while preserving model performance, which largely enhances the model's efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines on two benchmarks, with considerably low parameter usage (e.g.,, 0.32% of model parameters on VTAB-1k). We anticipate that this work will inspire further exploration within the pretrain-then-finetune paradigm for large-scale models.

  Figure 1: Overview of our E2VPT framework. Under the pretrain-then-finetune paradigm, only the prompts in the transformer's input and backbone, are updated during the fine-tuning process, while all other components remain frozen. We further introduce pruning at two levels of granularity (i.e., token-wise and segment-wise) in (d) to eliminate unfavorable input prompts during rewinding.

## Environment settings

See `env_setup.sh`

Note that you need to add a file (which is put in timm_added folder) to timm/models with path `anaconda3/envs/[envs-name]/lib/python3.7/site-packages/timm/models`, and init it in `__init__.py` by adding `from .vision_transformer_changeVK import *`.

## Structure of the this repo (key files are marked with üëâ):

- `src/configs`: handles config parameters for the experiments.
  
  * üëâ `src/config/config.py`: <u>main config setups for experiments and explanation for each of them. </u> 

- `src/data`: loading and setup input datasets. The `src/data/vtab_datasets` are borrowed from 

  [VTAB github repo](https://github.com/google-research/task_adaptation/tree/master/task_adaptation/data).


- `src/engine`: main training and eval actions here.

- `src/models`: handles backbone archs and heads for different fine-tuning protocols 

    * üëâ`src/models/vit_prompt`: <u>a folder contains the same backbones in `vit_backbones` folder,</u> specified for VPT. This folder should contain the same file names as those in  `vit_backbones`

    * üëâ `src/models/vit_models.py`: <u>main model for transformer-based models</u> ‚ùóÔ∏èNote‚ùóÔ∏è: Current version only support ViT, Swin and ViT with mae, moco-v3

    * `src/models/build_model.py`: main action here to utilize the config and build the model to train / eval.

- `src/solver`: optimization, losses and learning rate schedules.  
- `src/utils`: helper functions for io, loggings, training, visualizations. 
- üëâ`train.py`: call this one for training and eval a model with a specified transfer type.
- üëâ`tune_fgvc.py`: call this one for tuning learning rate and weight decay for a model with a specified transfer type. We used this script for FGVC tasks.
- üëâ`tune_vtab.py`: call this one for tuning vtab tasks: use 800/200 split to find the best lr and wd, and use the best lr/wd for the final runs
- `launch.py`: contains functions used to launch the job.

## Experiments

- Others:
  - RUN_N_TIMES: ensure only run once in case for duplicated submision, not used during vtab runs
  - OUTPUT_DIR: output dir of the final model and logs
  - MODEL.SAVE_CKPT: if set to `True`, will save model ckpts and final output of both val and test set

### Datasets preperation:

### Pre-trained model preperation

Download and place the pre-trained Transformer-based backbones to `MODEL.MODEL_ROOT` (ConvNeXt-Base and ResNet50 would be automatically downloaded via the links in the code). Note that you also need to rename the downloaded ViT-B/16 ckpt from `ViT-B_16.npz` to `imagenet21k_ViT-B_16.npz`.

See Table 9 in the Appendix for more details about pre-trained backbones.
